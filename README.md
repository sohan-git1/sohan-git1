# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sohan!

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about technology, problem-solving, and building solutions that make an impact. Here's a little about me:

---

## 🚀 About Me

- 🎓 **Master's in Computer Science and Information** (Western Illinois University)
  - Concentration: Artifical Intelligence, Machine Learning, Database Management, and Operating Systems.
- 🎓 **Bachelor's in Electronics and Communication Engineering** (Lovely Professional University)
  - Elective: Robotics and IoT
- 💻 **Software Engineer at Optum UnitedHealth Group Inc.**
  - I’m a Software Engineer currently working at Optum UnitedHealth Group Inc. in Chicago, IL. With expertise in designing and developing highly scalable microservices,
I leverage technologies like Java, C++, Python, Spring Boot, and Kubernetes to build efficient solutions. I also contribute to building modern web applications using 
Java Spring Boot, React.js, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap, hosted on Apache Tomcat servers. My testing toolkit includes JUnit, JMeter, Cucumber, and Selenium, ensuring the
robustness of the applications I develop. Beyond application development, I’ve architected a serverless high-performance computing application utilizing AWS services like
Lambda, EC2, S3, DynamoDB, and Route 53. This ensures reliability and scalability even during dynamic usage periods. Finally, I take pride in optimizing both relational 
and NoSQL databases (Oracle, MongoDB), achieving 100% data integrity for backend services.
 - 💻 **Previous Experience at Hewlett Packard Enterprise and Tech Mahindra.**
